## 💡 How It Works

The program processes user queries using a **centralized command processor**. Below are examples of what it can handle:

1. **Greeting and Interaction**:
   - Responds to "Hello", "Hi", "Good morning", etc., with contextual greetings.

2. **Weather Updates**:
   - Prompts the user for a city name and fetches current weather data.

3. **Web Search**:
   - Searches the web for user-provided queries and returns relevant results.

4. **Email Automation**:
   - Composes and sends emails based on user inputs for recipient, subject, and body.

5. **Wikipedia Search**:
   - Retrieves a summary of topics from Wikipedia.

6. **System Management**:
   - Supports opening apps, shutting down/restarting the system, taking screenshots, locking the PC, and more.

7. **Entertainment**:
   - Plays music or responds to entertainment-related commands like "Entertain me" or "I'm bored."

8. **News Updates**:
   - Fetches the latest headlines.

9. **Device Control**:
   - Toggles Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on/off.
   - Lists or terminates running processes.

10. **Emotional Support**:
    - Responds empathetically to statements like "I feel lonely."

11. **Exit**:
    - Recognizes exit phrases like "Goodbye," "Quit," and "Stop," and shuts down gracefully.

## 💡 Capabilities

- **Adaptability**: Can process a wide variety of commands.
- **Dynamic Learning**: If a query is unrecognized, it falls back to Gemini integration for processing.
- **System Interaction**: Allows deep interaction with the user's system and applications.
- **User-Centric Responses**: Designed to be empathetic and conversational.

## 💡 Planned Enhancements

1. **Multithreading**:
   - To improve task management and parallel execution for faster responses and reduced bottlenecks.
   
2. **Additional Features**:
   - Support for more APIs and integrations (e.g., calendars, task reminders).
   - Expand emotional response mechanisms.
   
3. **User Feedback**:
   - Implement a feedback mechanism to learn user preferences and improve over time.
